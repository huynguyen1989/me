## Are you a developer who scrolls like I do

As a software engineer, I often find myself drawn to the parallels between music and coding. The intricate patterns, the attention to detail, and the pursuit of perfection â€“ all these elements resonate deeply with me. And when I listen to B.B. King's iconic song "Riding with the King", I'm struck by the ways in which this blues masterpiece echoes the principles of good software design.

Was drag through the internet and it's placed me at the door of a country with ranking top in wide range of technology fields - Japan
