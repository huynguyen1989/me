<!-- POST-ID-6 -->
## Have you ever been a machinist?
I'm passionate about creating and building things with my own hands. I spend my free time in my home workshop, tinkering with metal and machines, and bringing my ideas to life.

We're living on a globe, and clearly, it's not really flat somehow..

Flatness is a critical aspect of machining, as it can significantly impact the performance, accuracy, and reliability of a part or assembly.

I've read and learned a lot about surface flatness and how to achieve precision flatness of around 10um or less. There's even a field of science dedicated to flatness.

## So, why am I doing this?
During the COVID-19 crisis and isolation, we really needed something to learn, relax, spend time, and exercise. I started learning about machining and became a machinist, seeking a break from the monotonous world of coding without ideas.


## Overview of flatness (manufacturing)
- Flatness is an important geometric condition for workpieces and tools. Flatness is the condition of a surface or derived median plane having all elements in one plane

- In the manufacture of precision parts and assemblies, especially where parts will be required to be connected across a surface area in an air-tight or liquid-tight manner, flatness is a critical quality of the manufactured surfaces. Such surfaces are usually machined or ground to achieve the required degree of flatness. Metrology of such a surface can confirm and ensure that the required degree of flatness has been achieved as a key step in a manufacturing processes.
