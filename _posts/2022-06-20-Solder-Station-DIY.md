## A good solder station without paying 1K+ USD
There're many types of solder station from manual to automatic iron cartridge 

## The needs
- I really need a micro-small soldering station with precise temperature control, which can prevent damage to electronic components due to prolonged exposure to high temperatures during soldering. From my previous experience soldering the 2SK170 Toshiba transistor, I found that heating it up to 350Â°C for 5 seconds can reduce its sensitivity.


## List of top solder station 2024

## Re-use of good cartridges for robot auto-solder

## Tempture controller PID

## AC current without rectifier for heater element

## ESP32 version attempting

## ATmega migration for solder application
