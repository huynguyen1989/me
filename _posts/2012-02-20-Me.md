# The Code that express parts of the world

## Introduce
The code itself is quite boring to someone, and some parts aren't working as intended, which puts the whole project into perspective. I've been worked in software industry for more than ten years

Upon completing my military duty (2010 [^2010]), I pursued higher education and went on to earn a Bachelor's degree[^degree] in Computer Science from Genetic Computer[^education]School and started my career path in software development since 2012. I'm a Vietnamese[^nationality] and living in Hanoi[^living], Viet Nam is a country located in Southeast Asia and we've complex history that spans over 4000 years.

Through years of self-development and a skill set driven by experience with simple to super complex systems, I'm capable of delivering high-quality code with code coverage reaching up to 100%.
